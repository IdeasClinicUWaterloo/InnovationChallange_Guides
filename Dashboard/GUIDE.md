## 1. Arduino IDE Setup

### Arduino Board and Port Setup
If you do not already have the Arduino IDE, you can download it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). We recommend downloading the first option - Arduino IDE 2.3.4.
Before you can begin coding, you should configure your Arduino IDE to the specific arduino you are using. In this case you will be using the "Arduino UNO R4 Minima".

1. Go to the bar at the top of the screen that reads "Select Board". 
2. Select the option "Select other board and port".
3. Search the board name "Arduino UNO R4 Minima", then select it.
4. Select the port which the arduino is connected to from the drop-down menu, then click "ok".<br>
**If the port you are using is not shown, select "show all ports".<br>
**If you don't know the port ID, go to your "Device Manager" to find the ID under "Ports".

### Installing Libraries
The required libraries for each sensor are listed in [Sensor Setup](#4-sensor-setup), use this [Link](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries/) for more help installing libraries.
#### Method 1: Using the Arduino R4
Search for the Library name in the ‘library manager” in the Arduino IDE and install. <br>
![Library Manger](Images/Arduino_Library_Manager.png)
#### Method 2: Downloading Library Zip File
##### Steps:
1. Download the library from GitHub as a .zip file <br>
![Zip Library in GitHub](Images/Git_Zip_Library.png)

2. Once downloaded simply browse to the Arduino IDE and add the library as a zip file. 
<br>(Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library) <br>
![Include Library](Images/Include_Library.png)
3. Browse to File -> Examples and then find your library and click on the example to get some example code for how to use that library. <br> 
![Libray Examples](Images/Library_Examples.png)

### Running Code
To upload the code to the Arduino, ensure that the correct port is selected, and press the button with the arrow in the top left. This will send the code to the Arduino and it will loop forever. If you want to restart your code, you can click the reset button (labeled RST on the shield next to the green light) once. If you want to erase the code from the Arduino without uploading new code, you can click this reset button twice. If you ever find that the code is failing to upload despite the correct port being selected, it is generally a good idea to try erasing the old code.


## 2. Communicating with the Arduino
All communication is done via the Serial port. You can view the serial port using your Arduino IDE by going to tools -> serial monitor from the menu at the top. You can also open it up as a graph view by opening the serial plotter in the same menu. Whenever there is a Serial.print() or Serial.println() command in the Arduino code, that information should show up in your serial monitor. 

#### Baud Rate
Any test code that uses the serial port runs a setup function to initialize the code settings. Serial.begin() initializes the Serial Monitor baud rate. Whatever number is initialized in the Setup() function must match the baud rate value in the Serial Monitor. Most of the time, your IDE will change it automatically, but it is important to check if things are not working. 

#### Arduino Code
* As well, the Arduino can read and respond to information sent to it from the serial port. 
* [Code to respond to serial inputs wrapped with <>, ex. < message >](https://github.com/IdeasClinicUWaterloo/InnovationChallange_Guides/blob/main/Dashboard/Arduino_Code/Serial_Communication/SerialReader/SerialReader.ino)

#### Python Code
* Python can also send and recieve messages through the serial port using the [PySerial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
* To install this library, follow steps 2.1 and 2.2 [here](https://github.com/IdeasClinicUWaterloo/InnovationChallange_Guides/blob/main/Computer_Vision/GUIDE.md#21-download-python-version-37---312), and then run ```pip install pyserial```
* [Python code to communicate with Arduino](Arduino_Code/Part_Testing/ArduinoToPython.py?ref_type=heads), to be used with an Arduino running the code above
* You will likely need to close the serial monitor in your Arduino IDE in order to run this code


## 3. Arduino Shield Connections
The Grove Base Shield V2 is an Arduino compatible board with Grove ports. This component fits directly on top of the Arduino UNO ports allowing for connections to be easily made to grove seeeduino modules (sensors) and multiple I2C connections. 
1. 4 Analog Ports: A0, A1, A2 and A3. 
2. 7 Digital Ports: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7 and D8. 
3. 1 UART Port: UART. 
4. I2C Ports: 4 I2C ports. 
5. Power Switch: when using Arduino UNO with Base Shield v2, **please turn the switch to 5v position.** This voltage is required for the shield to function, and is not meant to be changed at any point. If you need 3.3v for an external device, use the 3.3v port on the right side of the board in the blue rails.
6. Reset Buton: reset the arduino board. 
7. PWR LED: The Green LED turns on when power on. 

Each of the white connection ports is labelled with that port’s required connections. Each white port should only be connected to one sensor/module.  

The blue connection ports on the sides of the shield are directly above the ports they connect to on the Arduino. Please note that the white connection ports with the same name as a blue connection port are connected. This means if you have one sensor in the white D7 and another in the blue D7, they will interfere.

When connecting modules to the arduino, ensure wires are connected to the correct locations such that GND on the sensor goes to GND on the shield, VCC to VCC, SDA to SDA, and so on. 

For analog and digital pins, there are 4 connection points but only 3 are needed. The pin number that is printed on the shield next to the port is the connection that should be used for data transmission. <br>

   * This sensor is very large, so you will likely need to use multiple bread boards to connect it. Feel free to remove one of the positive/negative strips on the side to stick two boards together. You will need to use jumper wires to connect to this sensor.
   * Connect the pin labeled VDD on the chip to the 5v port on the Arduino, and connect the GND on the chip to the GND on the Arduino.
   * The pins labeled s0 and s1 control the output scaling (changing the scaling variable in the code controls these outputs.) Connect s0 to the D0 port on the Arduino, and s1 to D1.
   * The pins labeled s2 and s3 control which colour the chip is measuring (either red, green, blue, or white.) Connect s2 to the D2 port on the Arduino, and S3 to the D3 port.
   * The pin labeled OUT on the chip is what the Arduino uses to get the output from the chip. Connect OUT to port D4 on the Arduino.
   * If you would like to turn the LEDs on to brighten the area you are trying to measure, connect the LED pin on the chip to the 5v port on the Arduino.

   * [Datasheet: Purple Sensor](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/max30102.pdf)
* #### Hookup: SAME FOR BOTH SENSORS!!
   * On the pulse-oximeter sensor, two sides of the sensor there is a single connection point (GND or VIN), and on the other two sides there are three connection points (each with INT, SCL, and SDA).
   * This sensor uses an I2C connection, so we need to use the GND and VIN (VCC), as well as one set of the SDA and SCL pins (from the same side). INT pins are NOT used.
   * Use Breadboard to attach wires from the respected sensor pin to the Base Shield. 
* #### Code: SAME FOR BOTH SENSORS!!
   * [Pulse-Oximeter Test Code](Arduino_Code/Part_Testing/PulseOximeter_test/PulseOximeter_test.ino?ref_type=heads)
   * This code uses the serial plotter instead of the serial monitor. The numbers will still be shown on the monitor but the data will be very hard to understand.

## 6. Common Problems  
Type | Error   | How to Fix
-----|---------|---------------------
General |Sensor not reading any values   |- Push in all connections. <br> - Change wires to see if that’s the issue. <br> - Wrong pin/ port declared in setup, check values. 
General | Encountering Library Error codes | - Ensure all libraries called in code are installed and are accessable. <br> - Copy and paste code into new tab and run.
Compilation | "Could not open port" (Python) | - Ensure port name in “Device Manager” matches port referenced in code. <br> - Ensure Serial monitor in arduino is NOT open. <br> - Push in port connection wire.
Compilation |"Failed to retrieve language identifiers" (Arduino) | - Restart Arduino by pushing the reset button twice fast (built-in light should start pulsing).
Compilation |"Inconsistent use of indentation" (Python) | - “Shift” + “>” then type “tabs” and click “Convert Indentation to Tabs”.
Compilation |Not recognizing I2C devices | - Run I2C scanner and see if there are devices found.
